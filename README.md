Reaction Test Game –  Web Game
This is a Django-powered mini-game where players enter their name,
start a quick 30-second challenge, and click on targets as fast as possible to score points.
At the end of each round, scores are saved and displayed on a global leaderboard so everyone can compete for the top spot.
The site includes a simple home page with rules, a game play area built with JavaScript, results with performance stats, and a leaderboard showing today’s best and all-time scores.
